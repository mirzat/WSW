Train Timetable - CRUD


Hi,
Here is the full code for the SEFulltime - TrainExcercise. Please download all files to your local drive and you should be able to run the code directly. Create a database on your localhost by following the simple train.sql file and configuring the class.Database.php file for authentication. Start by opening index.html and uploading CSV files. Most action takes place in class.Timetable.php where the code is sufficiently commented for anyone to read easily. I have also added comments where the input data needs validation before processing and inserting into the database to prevent any sql injections. To keep this exercise simple, I have not added any sanitization to data, but have located the points where they need to be added for real world applications. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions. Thank you for taking the time to go over the code and I hope this is what you expected.
